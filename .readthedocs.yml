build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.10"
    # You can also specify other tool versions:
    # nodejs: "20"
    # rust: "1.70"
    # golang: "1.20"
  # jobs:
  #   pre_build: 
    # The "pip install --upgrade" commands run during build throw an error due to dime-pytorch not being able to fund numpy.  
    # Pre-install to prevent - alternatively we could customize the the build command to stop a lot of this boilerplate:
    # https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/build-customization.html
      # - pip install --find-links https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
      # - pip install dime-pytorch==1.0.1
  commands:
    - python -m pip install --exists-action=w --no-cache-dir -r docs/requirements.txt
    - python -m sphinx -T -b html -d docs/_build/doctrees -D language=en docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html

# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  fail_on_warning: false
  configuration: docs/conf.py
  # You can configure Sphinx to use a different builder, for instance use the dirhtml builder for simpler URLs
  # builder: "dirhtml"
  # Fail on all warnings to avoid broken references
  # fail_on_warning: true

# Optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF and ePub
# formats:
#    - pdf
#    - epub

# Optional but recommended, declare the Python requirements required
# to build your documentation
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html
#
# docs/requirements.txt can be generated using pip-tools (see https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html)
