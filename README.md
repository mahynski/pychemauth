# Description
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahynski/pychemauth/main/docs/_static/logo_no.png" height=100 align="left" />
This is a toolkit to perform chemometric analysis, though it is primarily focused on authentication. These methods are designed to follow scikit-learn’s estimator API so that they can be deployed in pipelines used with GridSearchCV, etc. and are compatible with workflows involving other modern machine learning (ML) tools. Please refer to the documentation hosted on <a href="https://pychemauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">readthedocs</a>.
