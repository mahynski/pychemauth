    k_outer : scalar(int), optional(default=10)
        K-fold for outer loop.

    Note
    ----
    This performs a version of repeated "flat CV" as defined in [1] to statistically compare the performance of two pipelines or models.  This is done by nesting flat CV inside an outer loop, akin to nested CV. This differs from scikit-learn's "built in" method of doing nested CV of cross_val_score(GridSeachCV()) in that cross_val_score() returns the scores from each test fold on the outer loop, obtained by training the best model on the entire inner set of training folds using the best hyperparameters determined by that the inner loop.  This is conventional "Nested CV" which uses the performance on the held-out test fold for an unbiased esimate of the generalization error [2].

    Here, we instead extract the performance estimates from the best model's validation fold (held out part of the inner training folds) used to select the hyperparameters for a given iteration of the outer loop.  These performance estimates are positively biased, but extensive real-world testing suggests that using the scores from the "flat CV" to **rank** different models does not make practical difference [2] to their relative ordering. Therefore, we can use the inner scores directly in concert with paired t-tests to compare different pipelines when it is too computationally expensive to do repeated nested CV.

    Unlike simple repetition of any CV procedure, framing this as a nested CV uses the outer loop as way to "shift" or decorrelate the data chunks more relative to simply reshuffling and reusing the data.  Thus, the Nadeau and Bengio's correction factor [3] for the t-test is less necessary, but further aids in making conservative inference.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pipeline : sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline or imblearn.pipeline.Pipeline
            Pipeline to evaluate.

        param_grid : list(dict)
            `GridSearchCV.param_grid` object to perform grid search over.

        X : ndarray(float, ndim=2)
            Dense 2D array of observations (rows) of features (columns).

        y : ndarray(float, int, or str, ndim=1)
            Array of targets.

        classification : bool, optional(default=True)
            Is this a classification task (otherwise assumed to be regression)?

        error_score : scalar(float, int, np.nan), optional(default=np.nan)
            Value to return as the score if a failure occurs during fitting.

        groups : array-like, optional(default=None)
            If specified, these are the groups used to perform splitting in cross-validation.  If `None` it is assumed there is no grouping.  For classification tasks, stratification is also performed.

        kennard_stone : bool, optional(default=False)
            If True, will use the Kennard-Stone algorithm [1] to perform the inner KFold cross-validation.  This ignores `groups` and does not stratify the data splits, so this is recommended only for regression tasks. The implementation used is from [2].

        -------
        scores : ndarray(float, ndim=1)
            Array of length K*R containing scores from all test folds.

        For an RxK nested loop, R*K total scores are returned.  For classification tasks, the folds are stratified.

            A list of pipelines or estimators that implements the `.fit()` and `.score()` methods. These can also be a `GridSearchCV` object.

        X : array-like(float, ndim=2)
            Matrix of features.

        y : array-like(float, int, or str, ndim=1)
            Array of outputs to predict.

        n_repeats : scalar(int), optional(default=5)
            Number of times cross-validator needs to be repeated.

        k : scalar(int), optional(default=2)
            K-fold cross-validation to use.

        random_state : scalar(int) or numpy.random.RandomState instance, optional(default=0)
            Controls the randomness of each repeated cross-validation instance.

        stratify : bool, optional(default=True)
            If True, use `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` or `RepeatedStratifiedGroupKFold`, depending on if `groups` is specified - this is only valid for classification tasks.

        groups : array-like(int or str, ndim=1), optional(default=None)
            Group each observation (row) in `X` belongs to.

        estimators_mask : list(array-like(bool, ndim=1)), optional(default=None)
            Which columns of `X` to use in each estimator; default of `None` uses all columns for all estimators.  If specified, a mask must be given for each estimator.

        kennard_stone : bool, optional(default=False)
            If True, will use the Kennard-Stone algorithm [1] to perform the k-Fold cross-validation.  This ignores `groups` and does not stratify the data splits, so this is recommended only for regression tasks. The implementation used is from [2].

        Returns
        -------
        scores : ndarray(float, ndim=2)
            List of scores for estimator.  Each row is a different estimator, in order of how they were provided, and each column is the result from a different test fold.

        Notes
        -----
        The random state of the CV is the same for each so each pipeline or algorithm is tested on exactly the same dataset.  This enables paired t-test hypothesis testing using these scores.

        When comparing 2 pipelines that use different columns of `X`, use the estimators_mask variables to specify which columns to use.

        scores1 : array-like(float, ndim=1)
            List of scores from pipeline 1.

        scores2 : array-like(float, ndim=1)
            List of scores from pipeline 2.

        n_repeats : scalar(int)
            Number of times k-fold was repeated (i.e., k_outer in BiasedNestedCV).

        ignore : scalar(float or int, or None), optional(default=np.nan)
            If any score is equal to this value (in either list of scores) their comparison is ignored.  This is to exclude scores from failed fits. sklearn's default `error_score` is `np.nan` so this is set as the default here, but a numeric value of 0 is also commonly used. A warning is raised if any scores are ignored.

        Returns
        -------
        p : scalar(float)
            p value

        Note
        ----
        Perform 1-sided hypothesis testing to see if any difference in pipelines' performances are statisically significant using a correlated, paired t-test with the Nadeau & Bengio (2003) correction. The test checks if the first pipeline is superior to the second using the alternative hypothesis, H1: mean(scores1-scores2) > 0.

        Reject H0 (that pipelines are equally good) in favor of H1 (pipeline1 is better) if p < alpha, otherwise fail to reject H0 (not enough evidence to suggest they are different). The formulation of this test is that pipeline1 has the best (average) performance or score of the two, and you want to check if that is statistically significant or not.

        Warning
        -------
        It is a good idea to manually check the scores for any `np.nan` or 0 values, etc. which can indicate a failed fit. Use `ignore` to exclude these points from the calculation.

        Bayesian comparison between pipelines to assess relative performance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scores1 : array-like(float, ndim=1)
            List of scores from each repeat of each CV fold for pipe1.

        scores2 : array-like(float, ndim=1)
            List of scores from each repeat of each CV fold for pipe2.

        n_repeats : scalar(int)
            Number of repetitions of cross validation.

        alpha : scalar(float)
            Statistical significance level.

        rope : scalar(float), optional(default=0.0)
            The width of the region of practical equivalence.

        Returns
        -------
        is_better : ndarray(bool, ndim=1)
            Boolean array which, if True, indicates there is a significant difference.

        probs : ndarray(float, ndim=1)
            Array of (prob_1, p_equiv, prob_2).

        Note
        ----
        Perform Bayesian analysis to predict the probability that pipe(line)1 outperforms pipe(line)2 based on repeated kfold cross validation results using a correlated t-test.

        If prob[X] > 1.0 - alpha, then you make the decision that X is better. If no prob's reach this threshold, make no decision about the super(infer)iority of the pipelines relative to each other.
