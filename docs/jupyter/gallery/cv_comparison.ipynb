    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook models were compared using nested cross-validation so that an uncertainty on the generalization error could be obtained.  **The question becomes, how do we know if these differences are statistically significant?** In principle, we can then perform standard hypothesis tests to check since we have means and uncertainties.  However, the main problem with this is that performance estimates are not independent of each other.  This tends to result in higher type I error (incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, which is two algorithms are the same) which means **you tend to see a difference in the performances when there isn't any.**"

    "Another issue is that many of these approaches do not account for hyperparameter selection.  They tend to use disjoint training sets to train the model and evaluate on a separate test set, but if you have to do hyperameter selection usually the final model is selected based on which performs the best on these test sets.  As a result that test performance is biased - this is the reason a separate validation set is usually introduced.  The methods below neglect this, but [recent work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09446.pdf) suggests that, while this bias exists, it does not strongly affect the relative ranking of models or pipelines."

    "The first way to obtain uncertainties on generalization performance is simply to shuffle the data and repeat the holdout procedure to get many different test set performances.  Statistical significance can be assessed by obtaining the mean and standard deviation for each model and performing a paired [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) on the differences.  If we use the same data split then both models are tested on the same \"chunk\" so we should use the paired version. However, a key assumption of the t-test is that measurements are independent; as you can see below for a small subset of data, reusing the data like this means points reoccur in many training (and test) sets, meaning each result is not independent.  This has been [shown](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.37.3325&rep=rep1&type=pdf) to yield an unacceptably high [type I error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) (detection of a difference between algorithms when there is none).\n",

In [frequentist statistics](https://www.statisticshowto.com/frequentist-statistics/) the null hypothesis is usually formulated so that the onus is one proving a difference between to things (e.g., the difference of 2 means), and is usually [stated as](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/#state) the currently accepted [truth](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/).  The burden of proof then falls on the researcher to disprove this and reject the current status quo in favor of something else."

Instead they recommend either (a) 100 runs of random resampling or (b) 10×10 repeated cross-validation with the Nadeau and Bengio correction (discussed above).
