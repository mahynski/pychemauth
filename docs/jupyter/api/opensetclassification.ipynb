    "\n",
    "To train such a model, these classes should be sampled (often evenly) in such a way that during testing / deployment the new observations will come from the same distribution as the training samples (IID).  Class balancing and cross-validation are common tools used to handle uncertainty in the latter of these assumptions, however, in the real world there are often many other (possibly infinite number of) classes that are not available at training time which a classifier might encounter when deployed.  \n",

    "Note that the \"face verification\" problem is essentially a one-class authentication problem. This \"open set\" of possibilities means that a classifier should be able to recognize the known classes seen during training, but also recognize when a test case is \"none of the above.\"  There are a variety of algorithms designed to do this and related tasks.  Here a few references that summarize some ontologies:\n",

    "The OSR task refers to when the model should be able to identify known classes and reject unknown ones.  By some classification schemes, the process of simply rejecting an input as being from an unknown class is referred to as a \"reject\" option.  OSR tasks are closely related to one-class classifiers (OCC) used for authentication purposes.  An OSR-capable model can be constructed by chaining together multiple OCCs, each designed to recognize a single class.  [Soft PLS-DA](../learn/plsda.ipynb) is another example of model capable of handling open-set conditions. Another *ad hoc*, but general, way to handle an OSR task is to combine an outlier detector with a closed set classifier (blue pathway below). Green and red pathways illustrate [\"compliant\" and \"rigorous\"](simca.ipynb#Building-an-Authenticator) OCC training schemes, respectively.  The \"pipeline\" is any composite model, possibly including other preprocessing steps.\n",

    "The outlier detector illustrated here determines if a sample is out of distribution (OOD), and sends only those in distribution (ID) to the classifier.  In this way, the outlier detector determines if the input is coming from a \"known\" region of parameter space which the classifier should be responsible for.  If not, the input is simply assigned to an \"unknown\" class.  Otherwise, the closed-set classifier is assumed to be responsible for identifying the input as one of its known classes.  The outlier detector itself may use a variety of different assumptions depending on which detector is used, as may the classifier, but this combination method is very general and can be applied with different sorts of outlier detectors and classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "An input point can shift from ID to OOD in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first is by [semantic shift](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3AWGg4CySNh#:~:text=Intuitively%2C%20covariate%20shift%20represents%20non,i.e%2C%20inter%2Dclass%20variation.); this occurs when a new, previously unknown, class appears.  For example, an new animal the model did not see during training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The other is by [covariate shift](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3AWGg4CySNh#:~:text=Intuitively%2C%20covariate%20shift%20represents%20non,i.e%2C%20inter%2Dclass%20variation.); this occurs when variance in a known class increases, usually due to a new \"type\" of that class.  For example, if we trained a model to recognize cats vs. dogs using high resolution images, but at test time a hand-drawn image of a dog is submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above workflow will (try) to catch both, though the main application lies in detecting semantic shifts since we typically attempt to build datasets that have representative examples of all sorts of the known classes.  Thus, we try to control covariate shift by carefully preparing the training data; this is, of course, imperfect and not always possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented a basic `OpenSetClassifier` model in PyChemAuth which we illustrate for a variety of different conditions below. Depending on the classification model being used the performance metric may vary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `OpenSetClassifier` works as follows:\n",
    "1. Select known classes to use from training data (typically all that are available).\n",
    "2. Send knowns to outlier detector (OD) to train it.\n",
    "3. Use fitted OD to predict inliers on training data.\n",
    "4. Send inlying, known class examples to classifier to train on.\n",
    "\n",
    "During test time, new samples are first given to the OD; if considered an inlier, then the classifier is called to identify the sample, otherwise it is labeled as \"unknown\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the underlying classification model is capable of detecting outliers (or rejecting acceptance, as in OCC) we should be able to combine those (1) rejected because the test sample belongs to an known alternative (\"known unknown\") with those (2) rejected because they are from an unknown alternative class (\"unknown unknown\") to compute performance metrics.  Sometimes it is useful to avoid this to identify why a sample was rejected (by the model or the outlier detector?).  Examples of this are illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many classification models available in both PyChemAuth and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html); the latter also offers various [outlier detection routines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html), but there are many more available in compatbile libraries such as [pyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)."

    "Here we will use an elliptical manifold to determine if a point is an outlier or inlier.  This is akin to using the robust covariance approach illustrated [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/miscellaneous/plot_anomaly_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-miscellaneous-plot-anomaly-comparison-py) and assumes that the inlying data is all located inside a single \"ellipse\".  For one-class classification instances, this can be reasonable, but **should be avoided for multiclass problems** since this will draw an ellipse around multiple class centers, possibly overlapping the region \"in between\" which makes the model susceptible to issues if there are alternative classes there.  In this example data, the versicolor class tends to be \"in between\" the other 2 and nicely demonstrates the issue."

    "\n",
    "Often a single (e.g., authentic) class may be well sampled while many possible alternatives are collected into a single \"alternative\" class, then a pseudo-binary model is trained in a \"one-vs-all\" (OvA) fashion.  The lack of a well-defined, well-sampled alternative class is one of the main reasons such models are typically inappropriate for authentication applications. However, it is possible to convert a binary OvA discriminator into a binary class model by adding an outlier detector.  This assumes that the two classes (authentic vs. known alternatives) are well sampled, so that the outlier detector is simply responsible for learning when covariate or semantic shifts occur and a sample moves out of the region of input space that a classifier is expected to be familiar with.  In this sense, we have a model which understands 2 classes: the authentic and the known alternatives, and both class spaces are bounded due to the outlier detector."

    "By adding an outlier detector, we can at least determine if a new sample looks different from both the known authentic class and the set of known alternatives.  These \"unknown unknowns\" are typically the reason that models fail under open set conditions.  The example below is not quite an authenticator since it uses both classes to evaluate the model performance, but we may consider it a class model since the outlier detector will reject any sample that is far away from the learned (finite) class space.  Since alternatives are used during training, this is a \"compliant\" approach rather than a \"rigorous\" one."
