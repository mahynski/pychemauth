PyChemAuth contains both original code and wrappers around other packages and thus relies on contributions from many other sources.
If you use these tools be sure to cite the original authors.

Code
####

If you use the Kennard-Stone features in PyChemAuth please cite the original authors:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @misc{kennard-stone,
   title={kennard-stone},
   author={yu9824},
   year={2021},
   howpublished={\url{https://github.com/yu9824/kennard_stone}},
   }

If you use UMAP refer to the authors' `github repo <https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap>`_ for information about citation.
At the very least, you should cite the manuscript associated with the software itself:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   title={UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection},
   author={McInnes, Leland and Healy, John and Saul, Nathaniel and Grossberger, Lukas},
   journal={The Journal of Open Source Software},
   volume={3},
   number={29},
   pages={861},
   year={2018}
   }

If you use `PyOD <https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ be sure to cite:

.. code-block:: bibtex
